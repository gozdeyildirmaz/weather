# WeatherApp
The aim of this project is to present the weather details of 5 cities in Europe.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4.

## Prerequisites
Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js. So, minimum Node.js version should be v12 to run untill 30.04.2022.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). You can see result in console as a output and also, Chrome browser opens and displays the test output in the "Jasmine HTML Reporter".

## Scaffolding

Considering large projects, modular structure was preferred in order to reduce the response time and the uploaded size via [Lazy Loading](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules).

For providing clear reusable code block, card component is created.

## Styling
SASS preprocessor is used because of helping developers to write clean, quick, and less CSS code in a program structure and helping reuse the values as many times as in the CSS and supporting of nested syntax.
